Notes taken on 5th June in Warwick on Pete's cloud meeting.
Talking to Simon Thompson who works at Birmingham and is CLIMB affiliated.

To make a BL image from my standard VBox image:

1) Remove VirtualBox drivers
2) Add cloud-init
     Edit cloud.cfg to make the manager account
     cloud-init expects to create the account itself - can it be told not to?
     At least, lock the password for the account
     Or maybe just lock SSH?  Needs thought.
3) Disable plymouth and set verbose text boot
4) Take off Network Manager, as you do on EOS Cloud
5) Convert VMDK to RAW using VBoxManage (see OpenStack docs) and discard the OVF stuff

Simon sent the following extra notes:

The avahi-autoipd, managed to get it clean off with apt-get purge instead
of remove, apparently the if-up.d script must have changed at some point?


To make the console and log work (/etc/default/grub):

GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=""
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="console=tty0 console=ttyS0,115200"


I still haven¹t got metadata service working properly, there¹s something
not quite right with my config maybe, it injected the ssh key into the
ubuntu user (and if I add that user to the ssh group I can then ssh in),
but I can¹t get it to do it into the manager user.

I will make a copy of my pack-for-esx and then adapt it for this system.
